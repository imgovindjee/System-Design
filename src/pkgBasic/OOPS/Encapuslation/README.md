# Encapsulation in Java

## Introduction

**Encapsulation** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the practice of **bundling data (variables) and methods** that operate on that data into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to the internal details.

Encapsulation in Java is achieved using:
1. **Access Modifiers** (`private`, `protected`, `public`)
2. **Getters and Setters**
3. **Data Hiding**

Encapsulation helps in **data protection, modularity, and maintainability** of the code.

## **What is Encapsulation?**

Encapsulation means **wrapping** the data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps protect data integrity and prevents unintended modifications.

### **Key Benefits of Encapsulation**
- **Data Hiding**: Prevents direct access to sensitive data.
- **Increased Security**: Controls how data is accessed and modified.
- **Improved Code Maintainability**: Allows changes without affecting other parts of the code.
- **Better Modularity**: Organizes the code into logical components.

## **Encapsulation Using Access Modifiers**

Java provides **access modifiers** to enforce encapsulation:
- **`private`**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **`protected`**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere.


## **Encapsulation in Real-World Applications**

Encapsulation is used in many real-world applications such as:
1. **Banking Systems** - Ensuring account details are private.
2. **Healthcare Applications** - Protecting patient records.
3. **E-Commerce Platforms** - Hiding payment processing details.
