# Interfaces

## Introduction

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an **interface** is a crucial concept that defines a contract for classes to follow. It allows multiple classes to share a common structure while enforcing certain behaviors. Interfaces are widely used in Java and other OOP languages to achieve **abstraction, polymorphism, and loose coupling**.

## What is an Interface?

An **interface** in Java is a collection of abstract methods (methods without implementation) that a class can implement. It defines a contract that the implementing classes must adhere to.

### **Key Characteristics of Interfaces**
- Defines a **contract** that implementing classes must follow.
- Cannot have instance variables (only `public static final` constants).
- All methods are **implicitly public and abstract** (unless they have a default or static implementation).
- Supports **multiple inheritance**, unlike classes.
- Improves **code flexibility and testability**.
