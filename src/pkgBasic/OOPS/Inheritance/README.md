# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction

**Inheritance** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (subclass or child class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or parent class). This promotes **code reuse**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**.

## **What is Inheritance?**

**Inheritance** is a mechanism where a child class derives properties and behaviors from a parent class. The child class can:
- Use the fields and methods of the parent class
- Override parent class methods to provide a specific implementation
- Add its own additional properties and methods

### **Key Benefits of Inheritance**
- **Code Reusability**: Avoids code duplication by reusing fields and methods of the parent class.
- **Improves Maintainability**: Reduces redundancy, making code easier to manage.
- **Enhances Extensibility**: New functionality can be added easily without modifying existing code.
