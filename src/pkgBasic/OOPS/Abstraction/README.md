# Abstraction in Java

## Introduction

**Abstraction** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to hide **implementation details** while exposing only the necessary parts of an object. This helps in reducing complexity and increasing maintainability.

Abstraction in Java is mainly achieved using:
1. **Abstract Classes**
2. **Interfaces**

## **What is Abstraction?**

**Abstraction** means showing only the **essential details** and hiding the **implementation**. It allows programmers to focus on **what an object does** rather than **how it does it**.

### **Key Benefits of Abstraction**
- **Reduces complexity**: Hides unnecessary implementation details.
- **Increases code reusability**: Encourages the reuse of abstracted logic.
- **Enhances security**: Protects internal object details from unintended modifications.
- **Improves maintainability**: Makes code easier to manage and update.
