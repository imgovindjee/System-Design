User should know the internal implementation (External Uses)
For eg:
    1. turn on FRIDGE
        - could contains many steps but USER SHOULD ONLY NEED TO CONNECT IT TO POWER SUPPLY
    2. "CTRL + C" for "copy", here USER SHOULDN'T BOTHER ABOUT HOW IT IS INTERNAL IMPLEMENTED



PROBLEM FROM ABOVE "Problem"
A. UNDO/REDO Functionality
    - if we implement this functionality then how it can be handle.
B. DIFFICULT IN CODE MAINTENANCE
    - What if in future, we have to support more command for more device eg. BULB, FRIDGE, etc
C. LACK OF ABSTRACTION
    - Today turnOnAC is simple but if there are more steps, clients has to be aware of that, which is not good
